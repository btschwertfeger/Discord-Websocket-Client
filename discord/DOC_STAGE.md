# Discord Stage Endpoints

# Important notes

The implementation of the methods was based on the official documentation of the Discord API. Parameters and endpoints have been adapted to it.
On the official page of the Discord API documentation you can see which requirements and parameters are needed for the respective methods.

Note: We have nothing to do with Discord and have not contributed to the Discord documentation!
